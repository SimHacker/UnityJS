Strangely enough, pie menus in blender was the first time I ever sat
down and took a (programming) idea to full completion. Before that all
I really was doing was hunt-and-peck at bugs and adding small
functionality where it was missing.

Had to learn me some vector math, fix bugs in the python openGL
wrappers, figure out how the openGL state machine actually works and
then get it all put together in a reasonable way. Turned out pretty
well and other people took that implementation and made it into a
complex addon that eventually ended up being widely used.

It might have changed in the years since I did any blender programming
but I had to do a lot of bug hunting and adding functionality to get
python scripts working -- which was fine since most of the stuff I
worked on was specifically to get the python API able to do whatever
random thing I (or, more likely, someone else) needed.

Cool -- thank you for keeping the pie rolling!

I love the way the new Blender 2.80 interface (which is a whole new
ball game) integrates pie menu layout as a first class citizen, so you
can nest any other kinds of user interface stuff inside of pie menus,
and everything just works.

Have you seen the astounding Pie Menu Editor extension? It's getting
seriously into HyperCard territory!

https://blendermarket.com/products/pie-menu-editor?ref=2

It's SO much more than just just a pie menu editor: you can edit all
kinds of blender user interfaces widgets, linear menus, dialogs,
panels, key bindings, macros, modal operators and properties. You can
make custom control panels and put them into pie menus, as well as
copying existing parts of the Blender user interface into your own pie
menus and panels! And of course you can script and customize
everything with Python.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-kU2IrTxk

It's really hard to convey everything it does, and the documentation
and demos are pretty sparse, but here is a playlist with lots of
examples:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTAsqEyZnEs&index=1&list=PLs...

Defining your own modal operators (interactive modes for live editing
with visual feedback, temporary key and mouse bindings, etc) is
particularly mind blowing! And those are great for invoking from pie
menus, enabling a very fluid live direct-manipulation editing style.

> Cool -- thank you for keeping the pie rolling!

Chances are pretty high I found some of your code laying around on the
interwebs and used that to figure out how it all works so you probably
deserve most of the credit;) Matt Ebb did a C prototype way back when
and gave me his code but it was too complicated to help out with the
python one I ended up writing.

Honestly I haven't been keeping up with what blender is doing since I
can't even open the new version due to my videocard being too old. I'd
be nice to get back to blender hacking (have some ideas on compiling
down the node trees using partial evaluation) but can't see a new
computer happening anytime in the near future.

Hi. In a recently closed topic regarding pie menus, LiquidApe said
that marking menus are a patent of Autodesk, a patent that would
expire shortly. The question is: When ? When could marking menus be
usable in Blender ? I couldn’t find any info on internet, mabie some
of you know.

Oct 2014

This is the old version now - a new version with internal support has
been added. Just enable Pie Menus (official) in the addons.

Blender 2.72 has Pie menus as a supported addon in the toolchest.

Pie menu breaks if spawned near window edge

Pie menus are sort of "clamped" in that if they are spawned closer to
the window edge than their spread radius
(UserPreferencesView.pie_menu_radius), instead of spawning partly
offscreen, instead they will spawn stuck to the edge and will
automatically validate the menu item that's in that direction. To make
it clearer, here is a capture.

This is a problem because pies can hardly be spawned in cramped
workspaces - for instance inside a graph editor occupying the lower
third of a standard 16:9 monitor, unless the radius is set super
small. This happens on Windows.

FeatureRequest: Scripts-Menu into the SPACEBAR-Toolbox

FeatureRequest: Scripts-Menu into the SPACEBAR-Toolbox
Post  by FastEddy » Mon Apr 17, 2006 9:50 am

I'd like to request to put the context depending Scripts-menu (e.g.
Mesh-->Scripts or Objects-->Scripts) additionally into the
SPACEBAR-Toolbox and give it perhaps its own hotkey, perhaps the #-Key
(like the Shift-A to call the Add-Menu directly). First I thought to
use the Ctrl+S, but it seems to be equal to Ctrl+W.

Nevermind: I think, putting the Scripts-menu to the Toolbox would be much quicker to use.

yes, exactly. or as SPACE with W, E, R, or K with A with S - anything
you like. I might be wrong, but I think softimage 3D had something
similar - hopefully this isn't patented!

Using the keyboard being patented? That must be a rich man.

Maya's marking menus ARE patented. They involve pressing a Key and
dragging with the mouse. IMO ingenious for handling maya's rich tool
arsenal, because you can map up to 8 strokes in each menu to a
function. multiply that by all possible keystrokes including standard
modifier keys...

new EDIT-mode

Post  by solmax » Sun Oct 10, 2004 3:25 am

disagree

first, you have to respect all keyboard layouts (german, english etc..
special characters often are on different places). second, tab and /
or ? are on opposite directions of the keyboard, but for a very
similar function. this wouldn't be good, then i'd rather use the
current menu.

joeris/ideasman's proposal would invoke two new different keys.

what speaks against cycling? it's a proven concept (LW users know),
it's fast and it doesnt force me to jump around the keyboard for a
very common operation.

if we want to avoid modes, it has to be done as in wings. however,
this makes selection more complicated on dense meshes - you have to
spend more time on targeting.

another possibility is using gestures. maya has something similar -
marking menus. once you know where the entries are, you don't even
look at them, only the direction you pull the mouse is relevant, so it
comes down to a gesture. unfortunately, maya's implementation is
patented, but maybe the patent could be avoided if we stick to
gestures only (without menus).

so tabbing would enter edit mode, and gestures (down, left, right)
would switch to verteces, edges, faces. drawback is that a lienar
gesture currently invokes grab, but i'm not sure if many ppl use this.

Post  by alt » Sun Oct 10, 2004 4:09 pm

>unfortunately, maya's implementation is patented

what exactly is patented?

pie menus (sector menus) are used a lot in games, too. and they were
not invented by alias, i think.

i remember that only the line that is drawn from the center of the
menu to mark the direction is patented.

hard to believe that you could patent something like that, though.

one of these days i move to US wonderland and patent "the use of
sequences consisting individual images (called shots from here on)
which are then arranged after each other in such a way that they seem
to be related and appear to have meaning, not because of individual
content of the shots(1), but because they are viewed one after
another"

and then i make a fortune. and get tax-cuts.

LMB-drag movements: does anyone really use them??

sedgetone wrote:

I'd like to keep the gestures as I use a pen and tablet 99% of the

I think LMB/RMB usage should be swapped. And then the gestures could
be improved, or replaced by a radial context-sensitive menu (not the
Toolbox, but much more specialised).

For improving gestures: after a short delay of holding the
mouse-button down the possible gestures could be shown as a overlay
map near the mouse-cursor.

Radial menus allow selections becoming gestures, but the best way to
push that are marking menus, and far as I know Alias has a patent on
them. :-(

Does anybody know more about that (googling didn't bring up anything
useful so far)?

Coding Pie Menus In Python

There are a few ways to create pie menus currently.

One is to define a subclass of menu in python and use the
context.window_manager.call_pie_menu operator

The other one is to use the context.window_manager.popup_menu_pie
function. For an example of how to do this check
WM_OT_context_pie_enum in

blender/release/scripts/startup/bl_operators.

There is also a pie menu template available in the text editor.

Nested layouts (a column layout as a radial item for instance) are
possible in this iteration of pie menus but are experimental and not
all widgets and layouts have been tested. Items in such sublayouts
will not use radial/directional interaction style. User will need to
hover over those buttons directly to activate them.

Suggestions:
Selection panel could have a short-cut pie sub-menu. Use similar layouts (like SimCity palette).
Tools can have sub-menus of variations (like the combinations of shift/alt/control keys, but self revealing).

----

https://blenderartists.org/t/pie-menu-on-snapping/1128348/24

I am not entirely agains radial menues, though. I do like them and I
do use them as well. In that case, though it doesn’t make too much
sense for me personally and I’d rather have them being customizable
for individual tasks than for mode changes.

Suggestion or request about the pie menus

User Interface  6 months ago

I would like the pie menu, when you stop releasing the key, disappear.
Do I have to pay someone to do it to me, I think it would be a simple
change for developers who already know where things are. In Maya it's
usual if you don't press the key, this disappear, they don't stay
permanently on screen forcing you to click out, if you really didn't
want to press and you did it by mistake. I admit that I don't like
them and I don't want to use them simply because of what I'm
commenting here, if they had that behavior I would use them with
pleasure. And since I see that now blender by default is intensively
using the pie menus, please if someone has the knowledge and is able
to change it I would be grateful in the soul.
