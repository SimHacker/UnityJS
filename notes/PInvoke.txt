To make a C# function you can pass into and call from C:

https://github.com/SoylentGraham/PopUnity/blob/master/Unity/Assets/PopUnity/PopUnity.cs

	[UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
	private delegate void DebugLogDelegate(string str);

		bool More = PopJob (Marshal.GetFunctionPointerForDelegate (mOnJobDelegate));
