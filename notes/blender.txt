/**
 * \name Pie Menu Levels
 *
 * Pie menus can't contain more than 8 items (yet). When using #uiItemsFullEnumO, a "More" button is created that calls
 * a new pie menu if the enum has too many items. We call this a new "level".
 * Indirect recursion is used, so that a theoretically unlimited number of items is supported.
 *
 * This is a implementation specifically for operator enums, needed since the object mode pie now has more than 8
 * items. Ideally we'd have some way of handling this for all kinds of pie items, but that's tricky.

[028fd29] master: Pie Menus C code backend.

Pie Menus C code backend. 

This commit merges the code in the pie-menu branch. 

As per decisions taken the last few days, there are no pie menus 
included and there will be an official add-on including overrides of 
some keys with pie menus. However, people will now be able to use the 
new code in python. 

Full Documentation is in http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Ref/

Thanks: 
Campbell Barton, Dalai Felinto and Ton Roosendaal for the code review 
and design comments 

Jonathan Williamson, Pawel Lyczkowski, Pablo Vazquez among others for 
suggestions during the development. 

Special Thanks to Sean Olson, for his support, suggestions, testing and 
merciless bugging so that I would finish the pie menu code. Without him 
we wouldn't be here. Also to the rest of the developers of the original 
python add-on, Patrick Moore and Dan Eicher and finally to Matt Ebb, who 
did the research and first implementation and whose code I used to get 
started.

Why doesn't my Custom Pie Menu work after restarting Blender?

So I would like to create custom pie menus. I have followed the
tutorial by Sebastian Kónig that seems quite popular... but it's as if
he leaves out the portion that tells you how to save it and have it
work when you restart Blender. Being an artist and total non-coder I'm
not even sure where to start figuring out why it's not working after a
restart. Could someone please explain to me what I need to do to make
this work? or perhaps point me to the section of the manual that
covers this? here is the tutorial I followed...

https://vimeo.com/103321600

do I need to check Register? this seems to be greyed out sometimes..
but not others. Do I need to save the script in a specific location?
Any help would be greatly appreciated :) cheers

The official one, made by Sebastian Koeing, comes with Blender

manually, since I don't have it.

Description	

Blender 2.8 now includes pie menus enabled by default for some key
features. Pressing the Z-key opens a pie menu with viewport shading
options. We also use pie menus now with the tilde key to set the
viewpoint.

Because 2.8 makes pie menus a default UI paradigm, it's a good time to
review other areas where we might want to use them.

About pie menus

Let's briefly revisit why pie menus are in interesting UI concept.

First, they allow us to map a setting, such as viewport shading, to a
single key shortcut, rather than several ones for each type. It means
we can make more efficient use of the keyboard, and we can free up
keys for other useful things.

Second, they make features easier to use, because the user only has to
learn and remember one shortcut for a given feature, rather than
several.

Third, pie menus are fast, because you can use them via a gesture.
Hold the key, swipe in the direction of the option you are looking
for, and then simply release. We take advantage of muscle memory to
allow quick interaction. With pie menus, we can surface more features
via direct shortcuts, which are faster to execute.

Now that we've started to include some pie menus by default in
Blender, it's time to review some other places where it would make
sense. Here's an ongoing list of features that would work well as a
pie menu:

Pivot Point

The Pivot Point setting is a perfect candidate for a pie menu.

In the 3D View, we have 5 types of pivot points, and one pivot option.

Currently, two of the five pivot point settings are mapped to comma
and period, respectively. The two next pivot point settings are
accessed by holding Ctrl and pressing comma or period. The last option
is accessed by holding Alt and pressing period. This means users have
to memorise five keyboard shortcuts for one feature, and we take up a
large portion of the keymap for just this one thing.

This is ripe for being converted into a pie menu, like so:


Only one key to remember
Only one key used (if we map this to comma, period can become free)
Fast access, with no need to hold modifier keys to access the various options

Transform Orientations

Currently, setting the transform orientations is done with
Alt+Spacebar. This displays a list menu with the various orientations.
This can be improved. The simple menu isn't very fast, because you
cannot use muscle memory and just use a gesture. Also, the
Alt+Spacebar is not as fast as a single key shortcut.

As a pie menu, we could make this faster to use, by leveraging the
gestural aspect, and mapping it to the now free period.

Proportional Editing

Currently, switching Proportional Editing types is performed with
Shift+O. Rather than opening a menu, it just cycles through the
various options. This is extremely slow, because you have to keep
cycling through all the options to get to the one you are looking for,
and even worse, if you tap Shift+O one time too many, you have to
cycle through all the options again.

We could make this a pie menu, which is both clearer and much faster:

Other candidates for pie menus:

Snapping
Snap To

Merge (Alt-M)
Grease Pencil Stroke Placement
Grease Pencil Drawing Plane
Etc

Pie menus could be added more places too - suggestions welcome

Description	
Now that we are adding more pie menus, we could make some small but effective improvements to them.

Wedge Highlighting
First, the wedge could be highlighted as you rollover it, to make it clearer how big the area is, like so:

Holding, Then Releasing Key Should Always Dismiss Pie

There's a slight quirk in the way we handle input: Normally, if you
hold a key to invoke a pie menu and then let go, the pie menu is
dismissed. This works if you move your cursor to an item, or to an
empty area. But, if you don't move the cursor at all, this doesn't
work. This makes the behaviour inconsistent, and makes the pies
'stick' in an annoying way if you regret opening one.

Letter Input While Pie is Active

While number input works reasonably well, in Blender we also use
letters to invoke options in menus. For pies, letters work better,
because the order makes less direct sense. There's nothing intuitive
that says left=1, right=2, and so on. We should enable letter input to
activate pie options. This way, user can press Z, S to activate Solid
Mode.

These three changes should make pie menus more delightful to use.

How would one code a pie menu with an additional traditional menu beneath it?

Pies

Many of the pie menus that are currently available are mostly a mess.
While it should be totally allowed that users configure their own
crazy pie menus, at least the ones that ship with Blender should be
laid out well and be an actual improvement for fast workflows.

We’re working on a pie menu design guideline page that should be
followed to ensure these qualities.

Pie Menus

We now include a set of pie menus by default, to make more efficient
use of the keyboard to group related features. Pie menus are fast
because you can use them via a gesture. Hold the key, swipe in a
direction, and release. Over time, users can gain muscle memory in
order to quickly repeat actions.

In the default keymap, pie menus are used for Orientation (,), Pivot
(.), viewport (~), shading (z), Snap (Shift-S) and Proportional
Editing Falloff (Shift-O)
