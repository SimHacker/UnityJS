Socket.IO Client Library for Unity (mono / .NET 2.0), which is ported from the JavaScript client version 1.1.0.

SocketIoClientDotNet by Quobject is a very good project, but it does not support Unity. So I spent a few overnights to port it to mono/.NET 2.0.

Now game developers can:

use node.js to develop game server, enjoy the powerful ecosystem of network and database, easily deploy to cloud;
use Unity to develop game client, enjoy the poweful game engine and IDE.
use websocket / socket.io to communicate between server/client.

It's available on Unity Asset Store for $10, but you can also download it for FREE here.

If you are interested to dig into the source code, welcome to fork the SocketIoClientDotNet for .NET 2.0.
