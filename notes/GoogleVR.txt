As written in Unity forum here:
https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/google-vr-sdk-1-10-unity-5-5-broken.445323/
for VR for cardboard development it' better for now to stick to using Unity 5.4.2 with Google VR SDK 10.3.

Google VR SDK 1.10 + Unity 5.5 broken?

Native GVR integration will be coming in Unity 5.6. The betas are out
now but I would hold off to beta 3 due to a few issues that took a
while to nail down.

If you want to use Cardboard with the legacy support provided by the
Google Unity SDK I believe that should be possible if you can find the
instructions on how to do that from the Google VR developer site. If
you go that route (and this is my guess here) I don't think that
Carboard will ever show up in the VR list and that you have to work
with the SDK using a standard Unity Android project that is not VR
enabled.

If you start with 5.4.3 GVR 13 you should have a fairly safe upgrade
path to Unity 5.6 when it launches.

Now, to the issue with 5.4.3: Are you sure that you have Android
selected as the target platform? Because Cardboard and Daydream ONLY
show up int he VR device list there.

When you say you "start the controller demo scene" what do you mean?
Do you mean you are installing and playing the app on a device or that
you are just running it in Play mode in the Unity editor? If the
latter, I am pretty sure that is not a supported scenario and that you
will need to use a Cardboard device. Also note that the controller
integration is for Daydream only. Cardboard does not support the
Daydream controller that I am aware of.
