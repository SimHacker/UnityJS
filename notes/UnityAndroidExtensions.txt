It calls the function for all libraries (I worked at unity, I know how it
works internally, it's easy for external libs, much more awkward on static
linked iOS projects  :)
I have a unique id and ignore other plugins' plugin events. (If the
cardboard sdk doesn't have a unique IssuePluginEvent id I'd highly
recommend one)
IIRC the first loaded lib is called first, but that order, I can't
remember. The important thing is that they ARE all called.

I'll try this in the morning... Can you elaborate at all on what the Google
lib does when distortion is enabled? I assume it must change a state I
don't handle. PluginEvent work is still synchronous on the render thread
(in the cardboard sdk case this obviously has to be on the main thread), so
something must be change in the state that possibly I can revert?
