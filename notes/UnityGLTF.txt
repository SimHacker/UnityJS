We have a slightly modified version of the app running on WebGL.

You can try this:

Revert WebRequestLoader.cs to this version:
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/UnityGLTF/blob/83d267f2616585fc8aba5391c003c9a5538ada97/UnityGLTF/Assets/UnityGLTF/Scripts/Loader/WebRequestLoader.cs

Alter this line

UnityGLTF/UnityGLTF/Assets/UnityGLTF/Scripts/GLTFComponent.cs

Line 100 in bb189f3

 loader = new WebRequestLoader(directoryPath); 
to loader = new WebRequestLoader(directoryPath, asyncCoroutineHelper);
And this line

UnityGLTF/UnityGLTF/Assets/UnityGLTF/Examples/MultiSceneComponent.cs

Line 24 in ce8485e

 _loader = new WebRequestLoader(directoryPath); 
to loader = new WebRequestLoader(directoryPath, _asyncCoroutineHelper);
Disable the Multithreaded property from the GLTFComponent.

So I have included 2 shaders in the graphics settings

Then I was waiting for like 3 hours for building, then I realize that it repeats "compiling shader variants" infinitely:


Why is that build process so miserable?

The Scene Loader for some reason wants to use always those 2 shaders for every loaded 3d model even if the model was made using simple unity default shaders. That is really strange. And you should include those 2 shaders in the graphics settings in order to have them in the build. Now building takes ages to compile thousands of shader variants.
